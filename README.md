# HW 2: Hello Hello Hello!

Follow these steps to get your project ready to work on:

1. clone this repo to your development machine
3. cd into the new directory (e.g., `$ cd hw2-hello-numerator`)
3. run `npm install` in the project directory (this will install all of the packages listed in package.json)
4. start working on your project


You will start with an app that looks like this:<br/>
<img src="https://github.com/SI669-internal/hw2-hello-starter/blob/main/assets/hw2-hello-before.png?raw=true" width=300/>
<br/>

Which you will transform to look like this: <br/>
<img src="https://github.com/SI669-internal/hw2-hello-starter/blob/main/assets/hw2-hello-after.png?raw=true" width=300/>
<br/>

There are a number of ways to do this, but here are some constraints you must follow:
1. Only use React Native's `View` and `Text` Commponents.
2. You may add or modify whatever `View` and/or `Text` Components you like, as well as their styles.
3. The dimensions of your components (e.g., `width`, `height`, `margin`, etc.) should be relative (i.e., use `width:'90%'` instead of `width: '480'`)
4. The sample files were all produced using named StyleSheet colors (e.g., 'green', 'purple'), but you may use other colors--even changing the color scheme entirely!--as long as you use the same number of colors and same general contrast pairs (e.g., green-white and white-green).
5. You should get the dimensions and layouts of all components as close as you can to those shown in the example. They don't have to match exactly but they should be pretty close.
